This is a comprehensive shell script designed to be the primary command-line interface for managing a complex, multi-container IBM Sterling Order Management (OM) development environment using Docker.

Let's break it down section by section.

High-Level Purpose

The script, likely named om-compose.sh, acts as a "master controller" or an orchestration tool. It automates all the common tasks a developer would need to perform when working with the IBM Sterling OM development toolkit. Instead of a developer needing to run dozens of complex docker, docker-compose, keytool, and application-specific commands, they can use simple, high-level commands provided by this script (e.g., setup, update-extn, start).

Detailed Breakdown
1. Initialization and Configuration (Lines 1-40)

Preamble: Standard bash script header and IBM copyright/license information.

Environment Variables: It sets up crucial path variables:

D: The directory where the script itself resides (compose directory).

PD: The parent directory of D (the main devtoolkit_docker directory).

OHD, OSD: Paths to related components like Order Hub and Order Service.

T: A timestamp, used for creating unique backup file names.

Loading Properties: This is a key part of its design. The script sources several .properties files.

set -o allexport: This is a clever trick. It tells the shell to automatically export any variable that is defined from this point on.

. $D/docker/docker-compose.properties, integration.properties, etc.: It loads configuration settings from these files. This is how a user configures the environment (e.g., setting database names, ports, feature flags like IV_ENABLE).

set +o allexport: Turns off the auto-export behavior.

In short: This section loads all user-defined settings from various property files and makes them available as environment variables for the rest of the script and for Docker Compose.

2. License Agreement Handling (Lines 42-81)

This is a legal requirement for enterprise software.

display_license: Shows the license text for all the bundled software (IBM OM, DB2, WebSphere, MQ). It pauses after each one, requiring the user to press Enter.

show_license:

First, it checks if the user has already accepted the license by setting DTK_LICENSE=accept in a properties file.

If not, it calls display_license and then enters a loop, prompting the user to type "accept".

If the user types "accept", it proceeds. If they don't, the script exits.

This logic is triggered specifically for setup commands to ensure the license is accepted before any installation occurs.

3. Logging and History (Lines 83-98)

This section sets up robust logging.

It creates a logs/backups directory.

Before running a command, it renames any existing log file for that command with a timestamp (e.g., om-compose_setup.log becomes om-compose_setup.log.2023_10_27_14_30_00).

exec 1> >(tee -a ...) and exec 2>&1: This is a powerful shell redirection. It sends all standard output (stdout) and standard error (stderr) to a process substitution that runs the tee command. tee does two things:

Prints the output to the console (so the user can see it).

Appends (-a) the output to a log file (logs/om-compose_${1}.log).

echo ... >> logs/xhistory.log: It keeps a simple history of all commands run in a separate file.

4. Core Logic and Helper Functions

This is the bulk of the script, containing functions that do the actual work.

build_and_run (Line 1242): The Master Orchestrator

This is the main function called by setup, setup-upg, and update-extn.

It follows a clear sequence:

Runs pre_checks to validate the environment.

Depending on the command, it might call wipe_clean (for fresh setup) or rem_old_for_upg (for upgrades).

Calls load_image to load the main application's Docker image from a .tar.gz file.

Calls prepare_runtime_props to generate dynamic configuration files for the application based on enabled features.

Calls prep_properties to create the .env file that Docker Compose uses for variable substitution.

Uses docker-compose up to start all the necessary services (database, message queue, app server, etc.).

Executes a series of steps inside the running containers using the exec_rt function (which calls a script inside the om-runtime container) to perform database setup, apply customizations, etc.

Calls post_services to set up things like MQ queues required by other integrated services.

Optionally calls extract-rt to copy the application runtime to the host machine for local development/debugging.

Container and Image Management:

rem_old_*_for_upg functions: A series of functions to systematically remove old Docker containers (om-runtime, om-appserver, etc.) and images to ensure a clean state for an upgrade.

wipe_clean: The most destructive command. It runs docker-compose down -v --remove-orphans, which stops and removes all containers, networks, and crucially, all data volumes.

Developer-Focused Functions:

extract_rt, extract_rt_props: Copies the application runtime files out of the om-runtime container onto the host machine. This is critical for developers who need to run command-line tools, use an IDE for debugging, or directly modify property files on their local machine.

start_server: Allows a developer to start an agent or integration server on their host machine using the extracted runtime, complete with options to attach a Java debugger.

extract_appman: Extracts the "Application Manager," a Swing-based GUI tool, so it can be run locally.

Resource Management (MQ & Certificates):

add_queue, delete_queue: Provides a simple way to manage MQ queues by executing runmqsc commands inside the om-mqserver container.

import_cert, remove_cert, list_all_certs: A complete toolkit for managing SSL/TLS certificates. It uses docker exec to run keytool (the Java certificate management tool) inside the om-appserver and om-runtime containers, modifying their keystores. This is essential for setting up secure connections to other services.

Data Management:

export_dbbackup: Creates a full binary backup of the DB2 database.

export_dbdata: Uses DB2's db2move and db2look utilities to export the database schema and data into a portable text/binary format, which can be imported into a fresh database.

Integration with Other Services (IV, SIM, Order Hub):

pre_services: Checks connectivity to cloud services like Inventory Visibility (IV). It even automatically downloads the service's SSL certificate to ensure a secure connection can be made.

iv_phase1_activator: Runs a specific command to activate a feature for a given enterprise.

setup_orderhub, setup_orderservice: These functions delegate tasks to other scripts (oh-compose.sh, orderservice-compose.sh), showing a modular design where this script is the main entry point that can call other specialized scripts.

5. Main Command Router (case statement, Line 1530)

This is the script's entry point. It reads the first argument ($1) provided by the user and executes the corresponding block of code.

setup, setup-upg, update-extn: All call the master build_and_run function.

start, stop, restart: Call the dcexec wrapper around docker-compose.

wipe-clean: Calls the wipe_clean function.

extract-rt: Calls the extract_runtime function.

add-queue, import-cert, etc.: Each command maps directly to one of the helper functions described above.

*) (default case): If the user enters an unknown command, it prints a detailed help/usage message listing all valid commands and a brief description of what they do.

Summary

This script is an excellent example of robust infrastructure automation for a development environment.

It abstracts complexity: A developer doesn't need to know the internals of Docker Compose, DB2, or MQ. They just use high-level commands.

It's configurable: All settings are externalized into .properties files, making it easy to adapt to different environments or user preferences without changing the script code.

It's idempotent (mostly): Commands like update-extn or restart can be run multiple times with the same result, which is a hallmark of good automation.

It's developer-centric: Features like extract-rt, start-agent with debugging, and extract-appman are specifically designed to make a developer's life easier.

It's safe: It includes license checks, backs up logs, and provides clear commands for destructive operations (wipe-clean).




More deep dive details


Let's do a deep dive into this script. I'll first explain what it is in a conceptual way, and then we will walk through its functions in granular detail, explaining not just what they do, but why they are designed that way.

Part 1: What Is This Script? The Big Picture

At its core, this script is a Development Toolkit Orchestrator.

Think of the IBM Sterling Order Management (OM) development environment as a complex construction site. You don't just have one building; you have several interdependent structures:

The Database Server (om-db2server): The foundation where all data is stored.

The Message Queue (om-mqserver): The communication system for sending messages between different parts of the application.

The Application Server (om-appserver): The main factory where business logic runs.

The Runtime Engine (om-runtime): A special workshop for building, customizing, and deploying the application code.

Integrated Services (Order Hub, etc.): Neighboring factories that need to connect and work with the main one.

A developer could try to manage all these pieces manually. They would need to learn dozens of specific commands for Docker, Docker Compose, DB2, IBM MQ, WebSphere (the app server), and the Sterling OM application itself. This is slow, complex, and highly error-prone.

This script, om-compose.sh, acts as the General Contractor for this entire construction site.

It provides a simple, unified, and powerful command-line interface (CLI) that hides all the underlying complexity. It knows the exact sequence of steps needed to perform any major task, from initial setup to applying a small code change.

In software design terms, this is an example of the Façade Pattern. It provides a simple, high-level "façade" (the script's commands like setup or import-cert) to a large and complex subsystem (the entire Dockerized OM environment).

Part 2: Detailed Functional Breakdown

Let's break down the script's functionality by theme.

Theme 1: Environment Lifecycle Management

These are the most important and complex commands, responsible for creating, upgrading, and destroying the entire environment.

setup <o:cust_jar>: Build a brand new environment from scratch.

What it does: This is the "day one" command. It meticulously builds the entire developer toolkit.

How it works (in detail):

pre_checks: It validates that your host machine and configuration are ready. It checks for a valid JDK, checks connectivity to cloud services, etc. This prevents a long process from failing halfway through.

wipe_clean: This is a safety measure. It runs docker-compose down -v --remove-orphans, which completely obliterates any previous environment. It removes containers, networks, and, most importantly, the data volumes (-v). This ensures the setup is truly "fresh."

load_image: It finds the main application Docker image (om-runtime-....tar.gz) and loads it into Docker using docker load. It's smart enough to find the latest version if multiple exist.

prep_properties: It gathers all settings from the various .properties files and consolidates them into a single .env file. Docker Compose automatically reads this file to get values for variables like ${DB_USER} or ${MQ_PORT} in the docker-compose.yml file.

docker-compose up -d: It starts all the "base" services (DB2, MQ, App Server) in the background. It uses --no-recreate to avoid rebuilding containers if they already exist and are up-to-date.

exec_rt '...': This is the application-specific magic. It uses docker exec om-runtime ... to run a script inside the om-runtime container. This internal script performs tasks like:

Creating the database schema.

Loading initial data.

Applying the customization JAR (cust_jar) if provided.

Building and deploying the final application (smcfs.ear) to the application server.

import_all_certs: It automatically imports any certificates you placed in the certificates directory into the Java keystores of the app server and runtime, setting up trust for secure connections.

post_services: It creates necessary MQ queues for integrated features like Order Hub or Inventory Visibility.

extract-rt (Optional): As a final convenience, it can copy the fully configured application runtime from the container to your host machine.

setup-upg <o:cust_jar>: Upgrade an existing environment to a new version.

What it does: This is for when IBM releases a new version of the OM software. It preserves your data while replacing the application code and containers.

How it works (in detail): It's similar to setup, but with crucial differences:

It does NOT run wipe_clean. Your database volume is precious and must be preserved.

It calls rem_old_conts_for_upg and rem_old_om_image to specifically remove the old application containers and image, making way for the new ones.

It then proceeds with loading the new image and running the upgrade scripts inside the om-runtime container, which will apply necessary database schema changes for the new version.

update-extn <o:cust_jar>: Apply a new customization to the existing environment.

What it does: This is the most common command a developer will use daily. You've made a code change, built a new customization JAR, and now you want to deploy it.

How it works (in detail):

It's a much lighter-weight process than setup.

It might restart the om-runtime and om-appserver containers.

It copies your new cust_jar into the om-runtime container.

It runs the internal update-extn script inside om-runtime which rebuilds the application EAR file with your new changes and redeploys it.

This is much faster than a full setup because the database and MQ server are left untouched.

Theme 2: Developer Enablement & Host Interaction

These functions bridge the gap between the isolated Docker world and the developer's local machine (the "host").

extract-rt: Get a local copy of the application runtime.

Why it's critical: Developers need to run tools from the command line (./deployer.sh, ./sci_ant.sh), use an IDE like Eclipse or IntelliJ to browse and debug code, and directly view/edit property files. They can't do this easily inside a container. This command copies the entire runtime directory from the om-runtime container to the devtoolkit_docker/runtime folder on the host.

start-agent <server> <o:port> <o:y>: Run and debug a background process locally.

Why it's critical: The OM application has many background processes called "agents" and "servers." This command allows a developer to start one of these processes directly on their host machine using the extracted runtime. The key feature is the ability to pass a debug port (<o:port>). This allows the developer to attach their IDE's debugger to the running process and step through the Java code line-by-line, which is essential for troubleshooting.

export-dbdata: Get a portable copy of your database's data.

Why it's useful: Sometimes a full binary backup is too much. This command uses DB2's native tools (db2move, db2look) to export the database schema (table definitions) and data into a set of text and .ixf files. This is perfect for:

Moving your data to a colleague's toolkit.

Checking the data into version control.

Setting up a fresh environment with a known good dataset (DB_IMPORTDATA=true).

Theme 3: Resource and Configuration Management

These are utility commands for managing the smaller pieces of the environment.

add-queue <name> & delete-queue <name>: Manage MQ Queues.

Why it's useful: Instead of the developer needing to learn the runmqsc command-line utility for IBM MQ, the script provides a simple, direct way to add or remove queues needed for testing new integrations.

import-cert <certfile> & remove-cert <alias>: Manage SSL Certificates.

Why it's useful: When connecting to external secure services (like a payment gateway or a shipping API), the application's Java environment needs to trust that service's SSL certificate. This command automates the complex keytool commands needed to import those certificates into the correct keystores inside the om-appserver and om-runtime containers.

Theme 4: The Command Router and Final Polish

The case Statement (Line 1530 onwards): This is the central dispatch of the script. It takes the first argument the user provides ($1) and matches it to a command. If it finds a match, it executes the corresponding function. If not, it falls through to the *) case, which prints a detailed help message listing all available commands.

Logging (exec 1> >(tee ...)): Every command's output is simultaneously shown on the screen and saved to a timestamped log file in the logs directory. This is invaluable for auditing what happened and for troubleshooting failures.

Conclusion

This script is far more than just a collection of commands. It is a carefully engineered automation framework that embodies best practices for managing a complex development environment. It promotes consistency, reduces human error, and dramatically accelerates the development lifecycle by allowing developers to focus on writing code, not on wrestling with infrastructure.
